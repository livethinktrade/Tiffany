# 2-Year Ironman Training System Plan

## Context

Michael wants to complete a Full Ironman (140.6 miles: 2.4mi swim, 112mi bike, 26.2mi run) but keeps deferring it year after year due to an all-or-nothing mindset. He believes Ironman training requires full-time commitment, which creates paralysis.

**Current State:**
- **Running:** Half marathon experience (solid endurance base)
- **Swimming:** Complete beginner
- **Biking:** Complete beginner
- **Primary Barrier:** All-or-nothing mindset ("it's like a full-time job")
- **Current Constraints:** Financial crisis (C1), job search is Priority 1
- **Tracking Preference:** Telos integration + Strava/TrainingPeaks
- **2026 Theme:** "Connection power health and self-care"
- **Existing Goal:** G5 - Achieve 15% body fat by 2028

## The Anti-All-Or-Nothing Strategy

The plan intentionally starts absurdly small (3-4 hours/week) to prove that Ironman training does NOT require full-time commitment. Research shows minimalist approaches exist at 2-4 hours/week for Sprint distance, progressing to 11-15 hours/week for Full Ironman.

**Key Principle:** Progressive distance building through race stepping stones:
1. **Year 1 (2026):** Build base fitness + complete Sprint & Olympic triathlons
2. **Year 2 (2027):** Half Ironman (70.3) in mid-2027, Full Ironman (140.6) in late 2027

## Year 1 (2026): Foundation & Short-Course Racing

### Phase 1: Foundation (Jan-Apr 2026) - "Prove It's Possible"
**Goal:** Establish consistency with minimal time investment
**Weekly Volume:** 3-4 hours total (can fit around job search)
**Structure:** 2 swims, 2 bikes, 2 runs per week

**Monthly Breakdown:**
- **Jan-Feb:** Learn to swim (lessons/YouTube), easy bike rides, easy runs (20-30 min each)
- **Mar-Apr:** Build to 30-45 min sessions, introduce brick workouts (bike-to-run transitions)

**Success Metric:** Complete 8 consecutive weeks without skipping more than 2 workouts

### Phase 2: Sprint Triathlon Prep (May-Jul 2026)
**Goal:** Complete first Sprint triathlon (0.5mi swim, 12mi bike, 3.1mi run)
**Weekly Volume:** 4-6 hours
**Target Race:** Sprint triathlon in July 2026

**Training Focus:**
- Build swim endurance to 500+ yards continuous
- Comfortable 15-20 mile bike rides
- Run 4-5 miles comfortably
- Practice transitions

**Success Metric:** Complete Sprint triathlon (finishing, not time-focused)

### Phase 3: Olympic Distance Prep (Aug-Nov 2026)
**Goal:** Complete Olympic distance triathlon (1.5km swim, 40km bike, 10km run)
**Weekly Volume:** 6-8 hours
**Target Race:** Olympic triathlon in November 2026

**Training Focus:**
- Build swim to 1500+ meters
- Comfortable 30-40 mile bike rides
- Run 8-10 miles comfortably
- Nutrition strategy practice

**Success Metric:** Complete Olympic distance triathlon

### Phase 4: Active Recovery & Base Building (Dec 2026)
**Goal:** Maintain fitness, reflect, plan for Year 2
**Weekly Volume:** 3-5 hours (unstructured, enjoyable)
**Focus:** Fun workouts, no pressure, recovery

## Year 2 (2027): Half Ironman & Full Ironman

### Phase 5: Half Ironman Build (Jan-Jun 2027)
**Goal:** Complete Half Ironman 70.3 (1.2mi swim, 56mi bike, 13.1mi run)
**Weekly Volume:** 8-12 hours
**Target Race:** Half Ironman in June 2027

**Training Focus:**
- Long weekend rides (40-60 miles)
- Long runs (10-13 miles)
- Open water swimming practice
- Nutrition and hydration dialed in

**Success Metric:** Complete Half Ironman

### Phase 6: Full Ironman Build (Jul-Nov 2027)
**Goal:** Complete Full Ironman 140.6
**Weekly Volume:** 11-15 hours (peak weeks)
**Target Race:** Full Ironman in November 2027

**Training Focus:**
- Very long rides (80-100+ miles)
- Long runs (16-20 miles)
- Back-to-back long workouts (Sat/Sun)
- Mental toughness training
- Race simulation days

**Success Metric:** Complete Full Ironman 140.6 miles

## Budget-Friendly Equipment Strategy

Given current financial constraints (C1), minimize costs:

**Essential (Phase 1-2):**
- YouTube swim lessons (free) before pool membership
- Use any bike you have or buy used ($200-400)
- Running shoes ($60-120)
- Public pool day passes ($5-10/session)

**Later Additions (Phase 3-4):**
- Pool membership ($30-50/month) when financially stable
- Better bike if needed (used market)
- Wetsuit for open water (used ~$100-200)

**Avoid:**
- Personal coach (use free online plans)
- Expensive tri bike ($3000+)
- Latest gear/gadgets

## Obsidian Tracking System Implementation

### Files to Create:

1. **`/mnt/d/Program Files/Obsidian/projects/ironman-training-log.md`**
   - Main project file tracking overall progress
   - Links to weekly training logs
   - Phase completion checkmarks
   - Race results

2. **`/mnt/d/Program Files/Obsidian/telos/systems/ironman-training-system.md`**
   - Training philosophy and principles
   - Weekly workout templates
   - Nutrition guidelines
   - Recovery protocols

3. **Daily Note Integration:**
   - Add "Training" section to daily note template
   - Quick log format: `## Training: [Swim 30min] [Bike 45min] [Rest]`
   - Links to Strava activities

4. **Weekly Review Template:**
   - Total hours trained
   - Workouts completed vs. planned
   - How body feels (1-10 scale)
   - Next week's focus

### Telos Integration:

**Update G5:**
```markdown
**G5 (→M1/M2):** Achieve 15% body fat and complete Full Ironman 140.6 by Nov 2027 through progressive triathlon training _(Energized, Light, Mobile)_
  - **Milestone 1 (Jul 2026):** Complete Sprint Triathlon
  - **Milestone 2 (Nov 2026):** Complete Olympic Distance Triathlon
  - **Milestone 3 (Jun 2027):** Complete Half Ironman 70.3
  - **Milestone 4 (Nov 2027):** Complete Full Ironman 140.6
```

**New Project:**
```markdown
**P2_26-01-15_ironman-progressive-training_ACTIVE (→G5, Priority 2):** Two-year progressive triathlon training program from Sprint → Olympic → Half → Full Ironman. Designed with anti-all-or-nothing approach starting at 3-4 hours/week. Tracks fitness progression, race milestones, and body composition goals. Integrated with Strava for activity tracking and daily notes for accountability.
```

## Accountability & Tracking

**Daily (5 min):**
- Log workout in daily note
- Sync Strava activity
- Body check-in (energy/soreness)

**Weekly (15 min):**
- Review weekly training log
- Update project file with completed workouts
- Plan next week's schedule
- Update telos trackers if needed

**Monthly (30 min):**
- Calculate total monthly hours
- Assess progress toward phase goals
- Adjust plan if needed (injury, life events)
- Update body fat % if tracking

**Quarterly (1 hour):**
- Major phase completion review
- Telos goal alignment check
- Gear/equipment assessment
- Next phase preparation

## Integration with Current Life Constraints

**Job Search Phase (Now - Q1 2026):**
- Training is SECONDARY to job search (S1 Priority 1)
- 3-4 hours/week is realistic and fits around interviews
- Use training as stress relief, not added pressure
- If job requires relocation, adjust race selections

**Post-Employment Phase (Q2 2026+):**
- Training can expand to 6-12 hours/week
- Financial stability enables pool membership, gear
- Structured weekly schedule easier with stable income

**Character Development Tie-In (C4):**
- Training = daily discipline practice (execute despite not feeling motivated)
- Rejection resilience transfer: racing is full of discomfort/pain, teaches perseverance
- Delayed gratification: 2-year goal requires trusting the process

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Start Ridiculously Small:** 3-4 hours/week in Phase 1 (NOT 10-15 hours)
2. **Race Registration as Commitment Device:** Sign up for Sprint race in Jan to create accountability
3. **Track Process, Not Outcomes:** Count "workouts completed" not "pace" or "watts"
4. **Permission to Adjust:** Life happens, financial crisis requires flexibility
5. **Celebrate Milestones:** Each race completion is a HUGE win

## Verification & Testing

**Week 1 Test:**
- Can Michael complete 3-4 hours of training while job searching?
- Does Obsidian tracking system take <5 min/day?
- Does this feel sustainable or overwhelming?

**Month 3 Checkpoint:**
- Has Michael maintained 8+ weeks consistency?
- Is all-or-nothing mindset reduced?
- Ready for Sprint triathlon registration?

**Year 1 Completion:**
- Did Michael complete Sprint + Olympic races?
- What was actual average weekly training hours?
- Adjust Year 2 plan based on learnings

## Implementation Steps (After Plan Approval)

1. Create ironman-training-log.md project file
2. Create ironman-training-system.md in telos/systems
3. Update telos G5 goal with milestones
4. Add P2_ironman project to telos
5. Create first 4-week training schedule (Phase 1)
6. Research local Sprint triathlons for Jul 2026
7. Set up Strava account (free tier)
8. Add training section to daily note template
