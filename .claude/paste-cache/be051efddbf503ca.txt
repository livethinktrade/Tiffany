Yes! Got it. This is fascinating — you've built a complete knowledge workflow (daily → weekly → TELOS) and want Clawdbot to feed into it.

Architecture integration possibilities:

Option 1: Direct file sync (simplest)

• Clawdbot writes to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (already does)
• Sync script copies/transforms to your Obsidian daily notes
• Could run via cron or as a skill
Option 2: Obsidian as primary store

• Point Clawdbot's workspace to your Obsidian vault
• Daily notes become the source of truth
• Weekly/TELOS analysis reads from same files
Option 3: Bidirectional sync

• Clawdbot logs conversations
• Obsidian reads them, generates summaries
• Summaries feed back into Clawdbot's MEMORY.md
Questions to design this:

1. Obsidian vault location? (path on this machine)
2. Daily notes format? (frontmatter? headings? structure)
3. How do you want conversations formatted?  • Raw transcript?
  • Summarized highlights?
  • Both?

4. Timing: End-of-day summary? Real-time append?
5. The old Tiffany system: What worked/didn't work about it?
Example flow we could build:

Clawdbot Telegram → session.jsonl → 
  ↓
Daily: Transform to Obsidian note (timestamped entries)
  ↓
EOD: AI summary appended to same note  
  ↓
Weekly: Your analysis (manual/AI-assisted)
  ↓
TELOS: Strategic insights

Quick test: If you share your Obsidian vault path, I can look at the structure and propose a concrete integration.

This is exactly the kind of second-brain system I should be feeding. Want to dive into the details?

You have access to it on the server the dir is called obsidian_vault

Perfect! I can see your Obsidian vault structure and the workflow. The old Tiffany system logged Telegram → Obsidian with timestamps. Let's rebuild that within Clawdbot's architecture.

Current State Analysis:

• Daily notes format: W{week#}-{date}.md (e.g., W02-2026-01-15.md)
• Entry style: **HH:MM** - Michael: message (timestamped)
• Weekly analysis: Processes combined daily notes → insights
• TELOS: Strategic layer from weekly insights
• Problem: Weekly analysis shows API errors (OpenRouter credit limits)
Proposed Integration Architecture:

Option A: Direct Writing (Simplicity)

Clawdbot appends to Obsidian daily notes in real-time:

Clawdbot Telegram → 
  ↓
Transform message + response → Obsidian format → 
  ↓
Append to `/root/obsidian_vault/daily_notes/W{week}-{date}.md`

Option B: End-of-Day Batch (Cleaner)

Cron job at 23:55 daily:

1. Reads Clawdbot session transcripts (*.jsonl)
2. Formats into Obsidian timestamp style
3. Appends to daily note
4. (Optional) Generates AI summary section
Option C: Hybrid (My Recommendation)

• Real-time: Log user messages immediately (**HH:MM** - Michael: ...)
• End-of-day: Add AI responses + generate summary section
• Weekly: Keep your existing analysis workflow
Technical Implementation:

Step 1: Create an obsidian-sync skill that:

• Maps Clawdbot's memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md → Obsidian W{week}-YYYY-MM-DD.md
• Formats entries in your timestamp style
• Handles both sides of conversation
Step 2: Add to heartbeat or cron:

# Daily at 23:55
clawdbot cron add --schedule "55 23 * * *" --text "Sync today's conversations to Obsidian"

Step 3: Weekly analysis fix:

• Update OpenRouter credits or switch to local model
• Ensure analysis runs successfully
Quick Test:

Want me to:

1. Create the sync skill skeleton?
2. Show a sample transformed entry?
3. Fix the weekly analysis API issue first?
Which approach feels right? Real-time logging (Option A) matches your old Tiffany system best.

Michael, [1/26/2026 12:29 AM]
Option A is best for me in the past in the old system, essentially there was an N8N workflow that basically automatically appends to the file because there is a workflow that just generates a new file every single day. It just appends to that file.

Ideally not ideally. It makes so much more sense to have a script that just every single time a message gets sent via Tiffany it gets sent and appended to the Obsidian file. The Obsidian Daily Note.

It does not make sense to use AI because it's a waste of tokens

Tiffany Accountability, [1/26/2026 12:30 AM]
Option A it is. Real-time logging, no AI fluff, just raw timestamped entries.

Immediate Implementation:

Step 1: Create a sync script that:

• Watches the session transcript (agent:main:main.jsonl)
• Formats entries as **HH:MM** - {sender}: {message}
• Appends to today's Obsidian note
• Runs every minute via cron
Step 2: Fix your weekly analysis (OpenRouter credit issue)

• Switch to DeepSeek v3.2 (now default) or local model
• Adjust token limits
Let me build this now:

1. First, find today's session file:

exec{"command":"find ~/.clawdbot -name \"*.jsonl\" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5"}

2. Create the sync script:

write{"path":"/root/clawd/sync-to-obsidian.sh","content":"#!/bin/bash\n# Sync Clawdbot messages to Obsidian daily notes\n\nOBSIDIAN_VAULT=\"/root/obsidian_vault\"\nSESSION_FILE=\"$HOME/.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/agent:main:main.jsonl\"\nTODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)\nWEEK=$(( ($(date +%j) - 1) / 7 ))\nWEEK_PADDED=$(printf \"%02d\" $WEEK)\nDAILY_NOTE=\"$OBSIDIAN_VAULT/daily_notes/W${WEEK_PADDED}-${TODAY}.md\"\n\n# Create note if missing\necho \"## $(date +%H:%M) - Sync started\" >> \"$DAILY_NOTE\"\n\n# Process new lines (simplified - will refine)\ntail -n 20 \"$SESSION_FILE\" | jq -r '\"[\(.timestamp)] \(.role): \(.content)\"' 2>/dev/null || true\n\necho \"Sync complete at $(date +%H:%M)\""}

3. Test with a cron entry:

exec{"command":"crontab -l"}

Want me to proceed with building the full sync now, or adjust the approach first?

Michael, [1/26/2026 12:34 AM]
if this helps here's my old code I use that work perfectly. Obviously you have to make adjustments according to what we have talked about in terms of integrating clawdbot and obsidian: # Generate date/time components
DATE=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%Y-%m-%d) 
TIME=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%H:%M)

# Generate week components
WEEK_NUM=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%U)
YEAR=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%Y)
WEEK_DATE=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%m-%d)
WEEKLY_ID="W${WEEK_NUM}-${YEAR}-${WEEK_DATE}"

# Create file path with weekly ID prefix
FILE="/home/node/obsidian_vault/daily_notes/${WEEKLY_ID}.md" 

# Log the conversation entry
echo -e "\n**${TIME}** - {{ $('Telegram Trigger1').item.json.message.from.first_name }}: {{ $('Input').item.json.input }}" >> "$FILE" 

# Confirmation message
echo "Logged conversation to $FILE"

I also want to learn about the obsidian skill that i saw on the clawdhub. what is that
