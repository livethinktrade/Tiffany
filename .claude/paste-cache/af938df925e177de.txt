4 Scorecard Rules to Quickly Scale Your Results
1. Every Number Has a Name
I got this from Steve Jobs, he called it a DRI (Direct Responsible Individual).

If you have a number… Instagram followers. Email subscribers. Sales targets.

It needs a name. Not a team name, not multiple people.

One person needs to own it.

If there's an issue, you know exactly who to talk to.

If there’s a win, you know exactly who to celebrate.

2. Every Goal Has a Colour
Red = not on track.

Yellow = kinda off track.

Green = good to go.

This simple traffic light system makes your data and progress skimmable.

It keeps people focused on the right things.

People literally self-adjust if you just put a red box next to their name.

3. Every Row Has a Trend Line
We’re trying to make it dead simple.

When you see a line from left to right that goes up, flat, or down, it tells a story.

Here's the thing... spreadsheets whisper, graphs shout.

If you want somebody to self-correct and have everybody on the team know how they're doing?

Design a graph that shows if they're not performing.

Then you’re not the one following up, everybody else will.

4. Every Week Has a Meeting
Most businesses are off target every day.

Just like a plane flying from New York to L.A. is off-course 90% of the flight.

The difference? Pilots have a dashboard that helps them adjust.

You need the same thing. Weekly.

Let your team report on the graph, and decide how it will change.

And I know most people won’t take any of this advice for ONE reason…

They don't want to know how bad it is.

They don't want to know that lead generation isn't working. That they haven't made enough sales this month.

It's crazy... the feeling associated with knowing is the reason they don't know.

Which causes them to fail even harder.

If you want to absolutely win in business… Measure and make it visible.

It unlocks bottlenecks. Highlights opportunities.

Do it every week. Non-negotiable.
