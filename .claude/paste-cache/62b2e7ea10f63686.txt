I need your help organizing this document. I'm going to create a whole new folder and then we're going to organize this data in here.

What's been happening is that I've set up an N8N or a Telegram bot, and anytime I text it, it dumps that data into this Markdown file via N8N.

Now, what we're going to do is we're going to mimic the Tiffany function, but the thing is that we need to start organizing this data here. This is my Aaron Dance Bot. What I've been doing is just logging anything or feedback that I've gotten, any new dance moves I find or I know, and also videos I say "oh, this is cool, I want to learn how to do this". The idea of this in the future or the future state of this is that we're setting up a structure program where I'm actually progressively getting better and practicing the basic fundamentals so I don't forget these things. Whenever I go dance, I can text the Telegram bot, and the Telegram bot then tells me "hey, practice these moves today, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom". Then we track it and we get tracks, and then in our new database, basically. We're mimicking the database we're going to use is probably in the NoCoDB database since I already have it set up, and all we need to do is just set up a new database and then get the API token. But we are planning on how this will look like before we implement.
