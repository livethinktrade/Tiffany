I can set a reminder for you tomorrow to configure or start using the Coding Agent skill. What exact time would you like the reminder to be?

1630 cst

It seems the cron job creation failed again due to payload format issues.

For now, I suggest I create the reminder message for 4:30 PM CST tomorrow using an n8n workflow or another alternative while I troubleshoot the cron payload requirements here.

Would you prefer me to do that instead so you get the reminder reliably?

why is creating a cron so difficult what's the problem explain to me so I can give you some help via claude

The main difficulty with creating cron jobs here arises from strict validation rules on the JSON payload used to define the job. The cron creation API expects a very specific schema for the payload, including exact field names, data types, and required properties. Some of the reasons it fails:

• The payload must contain a "text" property instead of a "message" property.
• The payload must have a "kind" field set to a single fixed constant string value; other variants cause errors.
• Unexpected or extra fields at the root or nested levels cause validation errors.
• The schedule object must follow a precise schema for expressing cron expressions or intervals.
• The entire payload JSON must strictly conform to a schema defined by the Clawdbot backend, or it rejects it.
Because of these strict constraints, repeatedly hitting validation errors is frustrating. It’s not a generic cron, but a tightly schema-driven job definition.

If you can ask Claude for advice or prompt examples matching Clawdbot’s cron API specs exactly, that could help unlock creating the cron jobs smoothly.

Would you like me to write a detailed prompt or system command for Claude explaining the problem and asking for correct cron job JSON examples to use in Clawdbot?Here is a proposed detailed prompt you can give Claude or another AI to help resolve the Clawdbot cron job creation problem:


System Prompt:

I am trying to create cron jobs in Clawdbot by sending a JSON job definition to the cron.add API endpoint, but I keep getting JSON schema validation errors.

The API expects a very strict JSON payload format, including:

• A "name" field for the job name.
• A "schedule" object describing the timing (either "kind" = "cron" and "expr" string for a cron expression, or another precise schema).
• A "sessionTarget" string to specify which session runs the job.
• A "payload" object with:  • A "kind" field that must be an exact constant string (e.g. "send_text").
  • A "text" or "message" field with the text to send (must not have both).
  • No extra unexpected fields.

• No unknown properties at root or nested levels.
• The entire JSON must be valid JSON5.
I have tried examples with:

• "payload": {"kind": "message", "message": "..."} - fails validation.
• "payload": {"kind": "text", "text": "..."} - fails validation.
• Including unexpected fields like "channel" at root level causes errors.
Please generate a minimal valid example JSON for a cron.add job in Clawdbot, scheduling at 8 AM daily, that sends a simple text message payload correctly.

Also provide an explanation of the required fields and any background on the schema constraints.
