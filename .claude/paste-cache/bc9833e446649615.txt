Back in the day, when I was working, what we entered doing was I had a Python script that would create SQL, and we would commit that into Azure DevOps. Then, Azure DevOps would ship it to Snowflake via deployment, so that way it allows us to do version control and all that stuff. What is that library or process called via Azure DevOps? This would allow hundreds of engineers to ship all at once without having to have issues. And on top of that, it adds more auditability and observability because we would go through the ITSM process as well.
The process you are describing is known as Database Change Management (DCM), and the specific Python-based library most commonly used for this in Azure DevOps and Snowflake environments is schemachange (formerly known as snowchange). 
This workflow allows for a robust CI/CD pipeline with the following key characteristics: 
Version Control: SQL migration scripts (often generated by Python) are committed to a Git repository in Azure Repos, providing a clear audit trail.
Automated Deployment: Azure Pipelines trigger upon a commit or pull request, executing the schemachange library to apply only the new or changed SQL scripts to Snowflake.
Scalability & Safety: It handles "clobbering" issues by tracking which scripts have already run via a metadata table (e.g., CHANGE_HISTORY) in Snowflake, allowing hundreds of engineers to contribute without conflicts.
