## ðŸŽ­ The Full Story

### The Problem We Encountered

Multi-model architecture pattern discovery during Claude Code hooks integration

### What We Initially Thought

We thought that We thought the hook system just used Claude for everything

This led us to believe the system worked in a certain way, and we approached the problem with these assumptions.

### What We Discovered Was Actually True

What we realized was that The system actually uses different AI models for different task types - Claude for complex reasoning, GPT-4o-mini/Haiku for simple status messages, Ollama for offline fallback

This was different from our initial understanding and required us to rethink our approach.

### The Journey: Troubleshooting Steps We Took

Analyzed the hook system code, discovered LLM utility modules with priority chains, realized the cost/speed/redundancy optimization strategy

These steps helped us uncover the real issue and guided us toward the solution.

### The Solution That Worked

Documented the multi-model architecture pattern and added it to PAI infrastructure planning

This solution addressed the actual problem rather than what we initially thought was wrong.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Lesson Learned

**So now we know:** Multi-model architecture enables 90% cost reduction on micro-tasks while maintaining redundancy and speed - this should be a core PAI infrastructure principle

This changes how we approach similar problems in the future because we understand the underlying mechanism better.
